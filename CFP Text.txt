Cafe

The Park Café is situated in the centre of the exciting and innovative Crowford Farm Park.
We appreciate the importance of eating good food, which we view as central to part of a healthy life style and therefore have an extensive menu, catering for children and adults. At Prestigious Catering Limited, we like to offer a varied menu to cater for all ages and palettes. From pasta to chicken fillets, burgers or jacket potatoes for children or perhaps a spicy homemade chili con carne or toasted ciabatta with melted cheese and side salad?  On chilly wintry days you can warm up with a bowl of tasty homemade soup.  Or enjoy an ice cream or sip a cool fruit juice on a hot summer’s day.

Our breakfasts are always popular, due to our award winning sausages and tasty eggs, which come from happy hens, free to roam in woodlands in the heart of the countryside. We werve top quality meat sourced from Norstead Manor Farm.
Each individual cup of coffee made at Park  Café comes from freshly ground coffee beans, sourced from Fair-trade.  Our tea comes from tea suppliers supporting the Rainforest Alliance.

Staff who are passionate about food, excellent personal service and high standards of hygiene and safety compliance ensure that we offer all our clients excellence and a memorable experience at The Park Café.

Burgess Park is well served with public transport. There is a car park, which has spaces for 25 cars with free parking for the first 4 hours.

Petting Zoo

Our petting zoo is a great and exciting experience for all ages of children and also adults. We come along to your venue on the day of your booking and set out all our displays of lovely and fascinating animals. We can take groups/classes or a general flow, and provide an interactive, handling experience with loads of information and fun facts. With our mini-tour, the children are introduced to each animal so they can grasp the fundamentals and the basic details such as species, name, habitat, environment, and diet. Our animal handlers will deal with all aspects of the petting zoo, providing a professional and absorbing experience.
With close ups with tarantulas, and scorpions, and handling of everything else from chickens, mice, and rats, through to cockroaches, lizards and of course the old favourite, snakes, there really is something for everybody.
We even have rabbits and guinea pigs for anybody a little more reserved. It’s a great experience and can be an event on its own or another attraction for fun and gala days.
